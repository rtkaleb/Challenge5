# 🧩 Challenge 5 – Order Management System  
### Spring Boot 3.x | Java 17 | PostgreSQL | REST API | Scrum Methodology

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Order Management System (OMS)** is a backend service developed using **Spring Boot 3.0** designed to handle order processing for an online retail company.  
This system improves **efficiency, flexibility, and scalability** in the management of customer orders by providing a robust structure for **order creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD)** operations.

It follows the **Scrum methodology** divided into **three Sprints**, ensuring iterative development, teamwork, and progressive delivery of value.

---

## 🎯 Objective and Scope

**Main Objective:**  
To design and implement a scalable backend service that streamlines order management in an e-commerce environment, ensuring data integrity, speed, and maintainability.

**Scope:**  
- Sprint 1 → Build the foundational API with Spring Boot 3, configure database integration, and document all endpoints.  
- Sprint 2 → Implement validations, relational consistency, API testing (Postman/Newman), and integrate logging and authentication.  
- Sprint 3 → Optimize scalability, connect with frontend or external microservices, and deploy in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS / Railway).
